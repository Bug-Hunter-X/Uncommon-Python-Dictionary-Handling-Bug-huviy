# Uncommon Python Dictionary Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Python involving the handling of duplicate keys within a dictionary. The `function_with_uncommon_error` function in `bug.py` incorrectly overwrites values when encountering duplicate keys, leading to data loss.

The corrected version, `function_with_uncommon_error_fixed`, in `bugSolution.py` demonstrates the proper approach to handle such cases, either by aggregating values or raising an exception.

The bug is subtle, highlighting a potential pitfall when working with dictionaries.
